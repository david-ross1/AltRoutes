# About 
MoreTrails is an AllTrails.com clone where users can connect with nature and each other through their explorations of regional parks and trails.
Users are provided detailed park and trail information, along with the opportunity to contribute reviews and photographs from their experiences.
MoreTrails was built with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL for the backend.  Photographs are stored with Amazon's AWS S3 cloud storage.  Frontend is React and Redux with CSS3.
